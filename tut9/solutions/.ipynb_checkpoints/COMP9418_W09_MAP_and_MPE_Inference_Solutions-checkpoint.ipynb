    "## The Extended Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "An essential part of answering MAP and MPE queries is recovering the instantiation with maximal probability. Remember that an MPE probability query has the following definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$MPE_P(\\textbf{e}) = max_{\\textbf{q}}⁡P(\\textbf{q},\\textbf{e})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, $\\textbf{q}$ are all variables in the network not present in $\\textbf{e}$. Therefore, we are looking for an instantiation $\\textbf{q}$ with maximal probability. The $MPE_P$ query returns such maximal probability, i.e., a numerical value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The MPE instantiation query returns the instantiation, that is, values associated with each variable in $\\textbf{q}$. We define the MPE instantiation query as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$MPE(e) = argmax_{\\textbf{q}}P(\\textbf{q},\\textbf{e})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use similar definitions for MAP queries. Remember that the main difference between MAP and MPE is that MAP queries typically involve a subset of the network variables. Therefore, MPE queries can be seen as a particular case of MAP queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep track of the most likely instantiations, we can use extended factors. The general idea is simple. We record the value of the eliminated variable in a list when computing the maximization operation. The next figure from the slides illustrates the concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./img/Ext_factors.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are eliminating variable $S$ through the maximization operation. In the case of the instantiation $C=yes, T_2=ve$, the two candidates are $S=male$ with probability $P(S=male,C=yes,T_2=ve)=.0220$ and $S=female$ with probability $P(S=female,C=yes,T_2=ve)=.0043$. The largest probability comes from $S=male$ and this value is recorded in the exteded field of the factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need an extended factor representation. While there are many possibilities, we will use something similar to our table representation. Our requirements are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We need one separated list of each possible combination of variable values in a factor. \n",
    "2. We need to record the variable name as well as the value assigned to this variable, such as $A=yes$.\n",
    "3. We need to start with an empty structure and add entries as we eliminate variables with maximization.\n",
    "4. We need to merge two lists when we join two factors since each one will have its extended field. Notice, as each variable is eliminated only once, the two lists of variables will be disjoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "We implement the extended field by adding an `ext` key to the factor dictionary. This key has a similar structure to the `table` key. It is an `odict` object will all possible combinations of variable values in the factor domain. However, instead of storing a number (probability), we will store a dictionary.\n",

To provide the correct output, `map_vars` should be the last variables of `order`. However, we will not enforce that constraint. Calling `map_vars` when `map_vars` are not the last variables in `order` has its utility since the output will be an upper bound to the MAP probability. \n",
