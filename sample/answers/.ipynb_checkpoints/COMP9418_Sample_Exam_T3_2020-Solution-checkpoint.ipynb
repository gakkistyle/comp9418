    "\n",
    "Markov chains were subject of two lectures: 8 and 14. Lecture 8 defined the chain and their properties such as regularity and peridiocidity as well as the concept of stationary distribution. Lecture 14 covered Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods such as Gibbs sampling. However, these techniques seem disconnected since Gibbs sampling is an approximate inference algorithm, while Markov chains are stochastic models. In this question, we ask you to elucidate the connections between these two methods.\n",

Therefore, when we sample from the stationary distribution we will be sampling from the network distribution. However, we need to guarantee that the Gibbs chain has mixed since we typically start from a random state that is far from the $P$. Unfortunately, there is no widely accepted test for mixing. Most tests accept that the chain has mixed when a good amount of evidence has been collected and none of it indicates that the chain has not mixed."
