    "We will use Jupyter Notebooks in the practical part of the tutorials. If you do not have Jupyter installed in your computer, we recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution). Anaconda conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.\n",

    "To render a graphical visualization of some graphs in this notebook, you also need to [install Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/download). If you have conda installed in your computer, you can try the command ```conda install python-graphviz``` directly. From our experience, Graphviz is a little troublesome to install in some systems. For instance, ```conda install python-graphviz``` often does not work on Linux systems and we did not have any success using ```pip3 install graphviz``` on most systems, so do *not* use ```pip3```. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have issues installing Jupyter Notebook in your computer, you can access the CSE VLAB. There are two possibilities. The most recommended is installing a [VNC software](https://taggi.cse.unsw.edu.au/FAQ/Really_quick_guide_to_VLAB/) in your computer. Alternatively, you can access these computers through a web interface using [CSE VLAB Gateway](https://vlabgateway.cse.unsw.edu.au/)."

We use a priority queue to sort these nodes according to the edge weight. The priority queue is implementated with a binary heap data structure using Python's [heapq](https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html) module. The node `u` with the smallest cost connecting to `s` is removed from the priority queue and inserted into the MST. The search expands to include the vertices that directly connect to `u`. These nodes are inserted into the priority queue, and the procedure repeats according to the following algorithm:\n",

    "The code we developed in this tutorial is straightforward, and some extensions will make it more robust. Some recommendations are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our DFS code implicitly assumes that the input graph is strongly connected. If it is not the case, the search only visits the connected component which the start node belongs to. Some implementations of the DFS embed the recursive function into a loop. The loop checks if there is any non-visited (white) node and re-starts the search from such a node. This procedure is guaranteed to visit all graph nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Similarly, our topological sort procedure assumes the graph is strongly connected. If the graph is disconnected, the function returns the topological ordering of the first connected component only. We can have a similar solution to DFS and re-start the procedure for every white node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we could implement some additional functions such as:\n",
    "1. Use the graph transpose routine to implement the Kosaraju's algorithm as we discussed in the theory part of this tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Change the Prim algorithm to find the *Maximal* Spanning Tree. Such implementation could be achieved by replacing the min-heap by a max-heap.\n",
