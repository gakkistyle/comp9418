    "## Propagating Messages\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now implement the code to propagate the messages over the elimination tree. The main steps in the algorithm are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a root node $r$ in the tree $T$\n",
    "2. Pull/collect messages towards root $r$\n",
    "3. Push/distribute messages away from root $r$\n",
    "5. return $\\phi_i \\prod_k M_{ki}$ for each node $i$ in tree $T$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can implement the pull step using a depth-first search. The general idea is to use the \"backtracking\" step of the recursion to calculate the messages. In other words, we start a depth-first search from the root $r$ until be find a dead-end. Such a dead-end is a node with only one neighbour. Therefore, we can calculate the message and associate to the edge between the dead-end node and its neighbour. This message is guaranteed to be towards the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we finish the pull step, we can also use a depth-first search to implement push step. In this case, we calculate a message every time we traverse an edge. Differently from the pull step, we will use the \"forward\" part of the recursion, so we guarantee the message is directed away from the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "One final, and important detail. The messages are calculated according to the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$M_{ij} = project(\\phi_i \\prod_{k \\neq j} M_{ki},S_{ij})$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $project(\\phi, S_{ij})$ is an operation that removes (by marginalization) all variables in $\\phi_i$ but the ones in $S_{ij}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical detail here is that when we compute a message from node $i$ to $j$ we multiply all incoming messages to $i$ except for the message from $j$. \n",
